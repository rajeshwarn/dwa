2
00:00:58.028 --> 00:01:00.613
<i>I was an elite soldier
in the vampire army.</i>

3
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.407
<i>A Death Dealer.</i>

4
00:01:04.117 --> 00:01:05.618
<i>And I was good at it.</i>

5
00:01:08.204 --> 00:01:09.664
<i>But I was betrayed.</i>

6
00:01:09.831 --> 00:01:13.626
<i>Viktor, our leader
and the most powerful vampire...</i>

7
00:01:13.793 --> 00:01:16.671
<i>was not the savior
he had led me to believe.</i>

8
00:01:18.465 --> 00:01:21.051
<i>Suddenly, allies turned enemies.</i>

9
00:01:21.217 --> 00:01:25.430
<i>The vampire Elders I had once
protected wanted me dead.</i>

10
00:01:27.557 --> 00:01:29.934
<i>Then I found Michael Corvin.</i>

11
00:01:30.101 --> 00:01:34.105
<i>Neither vampire nor Lycan,
Michael became a hybrid.</i>

12
00:01:35.482 --> 00:01:38.610
<i>We retaliated, killed the Elders.</i>

13
00:01:40.695 --> 00:01:43.573
<i>But then everything changed.</i>

14
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.662
<i>I was captured, not knowing that
I was carrying Michael's child.</i>

15
00:01:48.828 --> 00:01:51.790
<i>Eve, our daughter,
the first pure-blood hybrid...</i>

16
00:01:51.956 --> 00:01:54.209
<i>whose blood could end the war...</i>

17
00:01:54.376 --> 00:01:57.796
<i>became highly sought after
by both vampires and Lycans alike.</i>

18
00:02:01.925 --> 00:02:06.888
<i>My only choice was to hide her
from the world and from myself...</i>

19
00:02:07.055 --> 00:02:08.723
<i>so not even I could
lead them to her.</i>

20
00:02:11.851 --> 00:02:15.563
<i>I was an elite soldier
in the vampire army.</i>

21
00:02:19.401 --> 00:02:23.071
<i>My only choice was to
hide her from the world...</i>

22
00:02:23.863 --> 00:02:27.409
<i>so not even I could lead them to her.</i>

23
00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:44.843
<i>I have lived beyond my time.</i>

24
00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.805
<i>Another new moon
in 1000 years of new moons...</i>

25
00:02:50.557 --> 00:02:53.143
<i>and I do not care to see it.</i>

26
00:02:56.855 --> 00:02:58.023
<i>I have nothing.</i>

27
00:02:58.523 --> 00:02:59.733
<i>My coven...</i>

28
00:03:01.067 --> 00:03:02.777
<i>my daughter...</i>

29
00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:04.863
<i>- my love, all gone.</i>
- Cut her off!

30
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.033
<i>And soon, perhaps...</i>

31
00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:10.368
<i>my very existence.</i>

32
00:03:10.744 --> 00:03:12.120
- Selene's coming!
<i>- I am hunted...</i>

33
00:03:12.287 --> 00:03:14.497
<i>by vampires and Lycans.</i>

34
00:03:15.707 --> 00:03:19.336
<i>Now I am an outcast, a pariah.</i>

35
00:03:28.762 --> 00:03:32.807
- Put her down!
- Remember, he wants her alive.

36
00:03:32.974 --> 00:03:34.017
Fire!

37
00:03:38.063 --> 00:03:39.606
Come on, now.
Fire!

38
00:04:36.204 --> 00:04:38.957
You are an extremely difficult
person to keep track of.

39
00:04:39.124 --> 00:04:40.500
I don't need you.

40
00:04:42.252 --> 00:04:43.294
But thank you.

41
00:04:43.461 --> 00:04:44.587
Any word with Michael?

42
00:04:44.754 --> 00:04:46.881
- Stop tracking me!
- I'm not tracking you.

43
00:04:48.091 --> 00:04:49.300
I'm looking for Eve.

44
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.929
Well, I'm the very last person
who could help you find my daughter.

45
00:04:53.096 --> 00:04:56.182
Selene, listen to me.
The Lycans are moving again.

46
00:04:56.725 --> 00:04:57.809
No, this is different.

47
00:04:57.976 --> 00:05:00.353
They're organized.
They have a new leader.

48
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.520
- His name is Marius.
- I'm finished with this war.

49
00:05:02.564 --> 00:05:03.884
Well, it's not finished with you.

50
00:05:04.024 --> 00:05:05.184
They could have killed you...

51
00:05:05.275 --> 00:05:07.694
but clearly their mission
was to capture you.

52
00:05:07.861 --> 00:05:10.697
Your daughter's blood,
it's a prize.

53
00:05:10.864 --> 00:05:12.782
And if they find her,
if they use it...

54
00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:17.329
- Marius's power will be limitless.
- Well, then I hope she remains lost.

55
00:05:22.584 --> 00:05:24.419
I need you to deliver a message.

56
00:05:24.586 --> 00:05:26.671
Grunt if you understand.

57
00:05:26.838 --> 00:05:28.256
Tell your Marius...

58
00:05:28.423 --> 00:05:30.401
if he thinks he can extract
information from me...

59
00:05:30.425 --> 00:05:32.135
to locate my daughter,
he can't.

60
00:05:32.302 --> 00:05:34.471
I don't know where she is,
and I don't want to know.

61
00:05:34.929 --> 00:05:36.222
Marius will find you.

62
00:05:39.225 --> 00:05:41.102
Do you understand your message?

63
00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:52.947
What is it?

64
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.325
Have you seen this before?

65
00:05:55.492 --> 00:05:56.785
No...

66
00:05:56.951 --> 00:05:58.453
but we need to get it out.

67
00:06:02.332 --> 00:06:03.958
Let's go.

68
00:06:22.811 --> 00:06:24.229
<i>Bravo one, over.
Car approaching.</i>

69
00:06:24.396 --> 00:06:26.731
<i>- Access cleared.
- Close the gates.</i>

70
00:06:30.235 --> 00:06:31.695
<i>Commencing perimeter sweep.</i>

71
00:06:47.002 --> 00:06:49.462
Privilege to welcome you home at last, sir.

72
00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:51.715
Semira awaits you
in her private chambers.

73
00:06:51.881 --> 00:06:53.633
Semira?

74
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.260
Where is Cassius?

75
00:06:55.427 --> 00:06:57.238
The entire council will greet you,
of course, sir...

76
00:06:57.262 --> 00:07:00.557
but Semira requests
just a few moments.

77
00:07:00.724 --> 00:07:02.267
And your name is?

78
00:07:02.434 --> 00:07:03.852
Varga, sir.

79
00:07:04.019 --> 00:07:06.062
I shall try to remember it.

80
00:07:26.791 --> 00:07:29.544
And act accordingly
because of this tragic...

81
00:07:29.711 --> 00:07:31.338
Leave us.

82
00:07:34.424 --> 00:07:38.011
Darling Thomas.
It has been...

83
00:07:38.178 --> 00:07:40.555
- how long?
- Decades.

84
00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:42.390
Congratulations.

85
00:07:42.557 --> 00:07:44.035
I gather you have a seat
on the council.

86
00:07:44.059 --> 00:07:45.518
I could not be more proud.

87
00:07:46.394 --> 00:07:50.148
It's a shame that your return is not
under more festive circumstances.

88
00:07:50.315 --> 00:07:53.401
It is said that the Western Coven
was utterly destroyed.

89
00:07:53.568 --> 00:07:54.694
Yes, it was.

90
00:07:54.861 --> 00:07:56.821
It's a blessing
you escaped with your life.

91
00:07:58.114 --> 00:07:59.658
Well, many did not.

92
00:07:59.824 --> 00:08:02.160
There has been too much
death among our people.

93
00:08:02.327 --> 00:08:05.330
These urns are all that remain
of our Budapest Coven.

94
00:08:05.497 --> 00:08:07.457
Well, you have my condolences.

95
00:08:07.624 --> 00:08:10.794
We are losing the war, Thomas.

96
00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.255
If we stay as we are, our species
will be extinct within five years.

97
00:08:14.422 --> 00:08:16.007
Does Cassius share your view?

98
00:08:16.174 --> 00:08:18.069
The Lycans have regrouped,
replenished,

99
00:08:18.269 --> 00:08:19.970
and are resolved to exterminate us.

100
00:08:20.136 --> 00:08:23.056
Oh, surely, you're safe here.
The Eastern Coven is a fortress.

101
00:08:23.223 --> 00:08:25.350
We are no longer
the coven you remember.

102
00:08:25.517 --> 00:08:27.727
We have fewer Death Dealers
than ever before.

103
00:08:27.894 --> 00:08:30.146
You seem to be surrounded
by new cadets.

104
00:08:30.313 --> 00:08:33.525
Raw recruits, neither combat-ready
nor numerous enough...

105
00:08:33.733 --> 00:08:35.610
to repel a large-scale
Lycan attack.

106
00:08:36.569 --> 00:08:39.656
There has never been
a large-scale Lycan attack.

107
00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:42.367
At least not a coordinated one.

108
00:08:42.534 --> 00:08:45.203
There has never been a Marius.

109
00:08:45.996 --> 00:08:49.582
Pains me to admit it,
but for the first time in my life...

110
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.252
I genuinely fear for our future.

111
00:08:53.003 --> 00:08:55.255
So, what is your plan?

112
00:08:56.923 --> 00:08:59.592
Semira, you always have a plan.

113
00:08:59.759 --> 00:09:03.346
This little mise-en-scene
you're performing has a purpose.

114
00:09:03.513 --> 00:09:04.806
I am not a mind reader.

115
00:09:04.973 --> 00:09:06.808
Kindly do an old vampire the courtesy...

116
00:09:06.975 --> 00:09:10.353
of telling him why
he's been invited here.

117
00:09:14.274 --> 00:09:16.067
Selene.

118
00:09:16.234 --> 00:09:17.736
Come on. We need to keep moving.

119
00:09:17.902 --> 00:09:20.238
There are safe houses
far closer than this.

120
00:09:20.405 --> 00:09:22.282
I told you, they destroyed them.

121
00:09:22.449 --> 00:09:24.200
It's different now. Come on.

122
00:09:26.828 --> 00:09:28.538
But you signed her death warrant.

123
00:09:28.705 --> 00:09:30.790
Of course. I despise her.

124
00:09:30.957 --> 00:09:32.667
She killed Viktor. I was his regent.

125
00:09:32.834 --> 00:09:35.378
Until he met Selene.

126
00:09:35.545 --> 00:09:37.630
So you want her to hunt Marius?

127
00:09:37.797 --> 00:09:39.424
I want her to train our new recruits...

128
00:09:39.591 --> 00:09:42.510
so we have 100 Death Dealers
hunting Marius.

129
00:09:43.261 --> 00:09:45.096
I doubt she will agree.

130
00:09:45.263 --> 00:09:46.973
Her only concern is for her daughter.

131
00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.350
Eve, the hybrid.

132
00:09:48.516 --> 00:09:51.436
Unfortunately, the poor girl is half Lycan.

133
00:09:51.978 --> 00:09:53.998
It's a vampire's instinct
to condescend to Lycans...

134
00:09:54.022 --> 00:09:55.690
but they're not afraid to evolve.

135
00:09:55.857 --> 00:09:58.443
Meanwhile,
we stagnate from 1500 years...

136
00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:01.780
of this damned "species purity"
nonsense.

137
00:10:02.197 --> 00:10:03.990
And the irony is that Selene...

138
00:10:04.157 --> 00:10:06.868
- is probably the purest of us all.
- So the rumor's true?

139
00:10:07.285 --> 00:10:09.412
Her blood has elements
of the Corvinus strain?

140
00:10:09.579 --> 00:10:11.456
She is special.

141
00:10:12.999 --> 00:10:14.918
She brought my son back
from the dead.

142
00:10:16.461 --> 00:10:19.255
- Her blood restarted his heart.
- Impossible.

143
00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:24.427
I witnessed it myself.
She saved my son's life.

144
00:10:25.971 --> 00:10:28.598
Viktor and Amelia.

145
00:10:29.057 --> 00:10:32.102
Side by side for eternity.

146
00:10:34.813 --> 00:10:37.941
You were very fond of Amelia,
if I remember.

147
00:10:39.693 --> 00:10:41.595
I need you to be my ally on this.

148
00:10:41.795 --> 00:10:43.697
She won't risk coming here...

149
00:10:43.863 --> 00:10:46.491
unless she gets an invitation
from the whole council.

150
00:10:46.658 --> 00:10:48.743
And I could never solicit such a request.

151
00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:50.870
Cassius is protective of the old ways.

152
00:10:51.037 --> 00:10:54.207
He barely tolerates my seat
on the council as it is.

153
00:10:54.666 --> 00:10:57.502
But these are desperate times, Thomas.

154
00:10:57.669 --> 00:11:01.423
And that is why you
must convince the council to invite her.

155
00:11:02.924 --> 00:11:04.300
They arrive tonight.

156
00:11:04.467 --> 00:11:07.637
<i>Dawn alert.
60 seconds to sunrise.</i>

157
00:11:37.042 --> 00:11:38.877
Marius, the pack leaders have arrived...

158
00:11:39.044 --> 00:11:41.463
and I told them to wait
for you in the war room.

159
00:11:41.629 --> 00:11:43.109
They're fighting like dogs, no doubt.

160
00:11:43.173 --> 00:11:45.675
- I'll handle it. Thank you.
- All right.

161
00:11:50.263 --> 00:11:51.765
- Go on, then.
- Right, right.

162
00:11:51.931 --> 00:11:52.932
Come around, come around.

163
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:54.684
No! Listen to me.

164
00:11:54.851 --> 00:11:56.895
We're gonna wedge them in.
That's what we do.

165
00:11:57.062 --> 00:11:58.956
From this side and that side,
we just wedge them in...

166
00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:00.620
- and squeeze them out.
- Wedge them in?

167
00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:03.443
Is that your plan?
It's not going to lead to anything.

168
00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:04.944
- He's getting angry.
- Shut up!

169
00:12:05.612 --> 00:12:07.489
Stop!

170
00:12:11.451 --> 00:12:13.453
- Are you a slave?
- No.

171
00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:15.205
Then don't behave like one.

172
00:12:16.956 --> 00:12:18.625
Look at this map.

173
00:12:18.792 --> 00:12:20.418
What do you see?

174
00:12:20.585 --> 00:12:22.462
Do you see Lycans
fighting over scraps?

175
00:12:24.214 --> 00:12:25.965
I'll tell you what I see.

176
00:12:26.591 --> 00:12:27.884
Volhynia.

177
00:12:28.426 --> 00:12:31.012
Nordgau. Thuringia.

178
00:12:31.179 --> 00:12:32.263
The Lycan victories.

179
00:12:34.224 --> 00:12:35.600
I see vampires dead.

180
00:12:35.767 --> 00:12:37.310
I see entire regions annihilated.

181
00:12:37.477 --> 00:12:39.854
But we will get no further
if we fight amongst ourselves.

182
00:12:40.689 --> 00:12:42.190
We must not rest...

183
00:12:42.357 --> 00:12:45.735
until we have destroyed
their final sanctuary.

184
00:12:46.319 --> 00:12:49.197
Together, we are strong.

185
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:53.660
And when we have the blood
of the hybrid girl...

186
00:12:55.495 --> 00:12:57.622
we will be invincible.

187
00:13:05.672 --> 00:13:07.173
Gregor.

188
00:13:08.883 --> 00:13:10.510
You have returned alone.

189
00:13:11.886 --> 00:13:14.097
- We were taken by surprise.
- Where is Selene?

190
00:13:14.764 --> 00:13:16.975
- She spared me.
- Why?

191
00:13:17.142 --> 00:13:18.560
To deliver a message.

192
00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:22.689
She wants you to know
that her daughter is gone forever...

193
00:13:22.856 --> 00:13:24.399
that you can never find her...

194
00:13:24.566 --> 00:13:27.402
because even Selene
doesn't know where she's been hidden.

195
00:13:27.694 --> 00:13:28.695
Do you believe her?

196
00:13:33.158 --> 00:13:34.409
Do you believe her?

197
00:13:41.166 --> 00:13:43.793
I put a tracer in her companion.

198
00:13:45.337 --> 00:13:46.838
Well...

199
00:13:48.048 --> 00:13:50.925
that means you're not
completely incompetent.

200
00:14:05.398 --> 00:14:06.650
Try and stay still.

201
00:14:10.528 --> 00:14:13.156
- What is it?
- It's some sort of bullet.

202
00:14:13.323 --> 00:14:16.076
It's burrowing through you
faster than you can heal.

203
00:14:16.242 --> 00:14:17.535
It's self-propelled.

204
00:14:17.702 --> 00:14:19.454
That's what I was
trying to tell you.

205
00:14:19.654 --> 00:14:21.122
These Lycans are sophisticated.

206
00:14:24.167 --> 00:14:26.252
I don't know if I can remove it in time.

207
00:14:26.419 --> 00:14:28.700
Well, the least you can do
is attempt to sound reassuring.

208
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:30.840
I'm going to attempt not to kill you.

209
00:14:31.966 --> 00:14:33.802
That will have to do.

210
00:15:08.086 --> 00:15:11.881
To whom do you want us
to offer safe haven and amnesty?

211
00:15:12.048 --> 00:15:15.635
- To Selene the Death Dealer.
- The same Selene who murdered Viktor?

212
00:15:15.802 --> 00:15:17.762
I need no reminder, Cassius,
of what she has done.

213
00:15:17.887 --> 00:15:19.055
Shame on you, sir.

214
00:15:19.222 --> 00:15:22.100
I will not hear her name spoken again.

215
00:15:22.309 --> 00:15:24.394
Cassius, I share your outrage.

216
00:15:25.228 --> 00:15:27.314
Whatever has possessed you?

217
00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.024
If we don't act decisively...

218
00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:31.190
the war will be at your gate
within a fortnight.

219
00:15:31.693 --> 00:15:34.112
And that is precisely where it will remain.

220
00:15:34.279 --> 00:15:37.449
No Lycan pack would dare
to attack our coven.

221
00:15:37.615 --> 00:15:39.743
Our defenses would rip them apart.

222
00:15:39.909 --> 00:15:42.162
An ordinary Lycan pack, perhaps...

223
00:15:42.329 --> 00:15:45.498
but Marius has gathered a force
far more powerful than any...

224
00:15:45.665 --> 00:15:46.958
Unsubstantiated hyperbole.

225
00:15:47.125 --> 00:15:48.960
You need Selene.

226
00:15:49.127 --> 00:15:53.757
Her prowess, her leadership,
her intimate knowledge of Lycans.

227
00:15:53.923 --> 00:15:56.468
And her combat skills
are second to none.

228
00:15:56.634 --> 00:15:59.137
He's right, she is the most
lethal Death Dealer we've ever had.

229
00:15:59.346 --> 00:16:02.849
But she killed one of her own.

230
00:16:03.016 --> 00:16:07.062
Not only the most powerful
and respected of the Elders...

231
00:16:07.228 --> 00:16:11.650
her protector, who loved her
like his own daughter.

232
00:16:11.816 --> 00:16:13.693
She cannot be trusted.

233
00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:15.111
She has been judged.

234
00:16:15.278 --> 00:16:17.864
Perhaps she can also be redeemed.

235
00:16:18.031 --> 00:16:20.533
It pains me to say it,
but Thomas is right.

236
00:16:20.992 --> 00:16:23.662
No warrior has proved herself
more in battle.

237
00:16:23.828 --> 00:16:27.082
She would be invaluable
in our fight against Marius...

238
00:16:27.248 --> 00:16:31.294
perhaps even the pivotal
element to secure our victory.

239
00:16:33.755 --> 00:16:35.840
If she can be found...

240
00:16:36.007 --> 00:16:40.512
and sets foot
within this precious coven...

241
00:16:40.804 --> 00:16:43.848
I will hold you, Semira,
personally responsible...

242
00:16:44.015 --> 00:16:45.767
- for controlling her.
- Of course.

243
00:17:10.166 --> 00:17:14.421
<i>Intruder. Intruder. Intruder.</i>

244
00:17:14.587 --> 00:17:16.464
<i>Intruder. Intruder.</i>

245
00:17:30.854 --> 00:17:32.480
Who sent you?

246
00:17:33.898 --> 00:17:35.567
Drop it.

247
00:17:41.031 --> 00:17:42.365
How'd you find us?

248
00:17:42.699 --> 00:17:44.784
There are only a handful
of safe houses left.

249
00:17:45.535 --> 00:17:47.871
The Lycans made it rather easy.

250
00:17:48.038 --> 00:17:50.457
The council of the Eastern Coven
sent me to bring you in.

251
00:17:50.623 --> 00:17:52.334
- For trial?
- No.

252
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:53.960
For your safety, and ours.

253
00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.463
You cannot expect
me to believe that.

254
00:17:56.629 --> 00:17:58.882
Every single one of them
signed my death warrant.

255
00:17:59.049 --> 00:18:01.176
- Times change.
- Vampires do not.

256
00:18:01.634 --> 00:18:02.886
This is from your father.

257
00:18:05.263 --> 00:18:07.307
Is it authentic?

258
00:18:07.474 --> 00:18:09.517
It's his seal, his handwriting.

259
00:18:09.684 --> 00:18:11.302
The council has
offered you clemency

260
00:18:11.502 --> 00:18:12.896
and granted us
both safe haven.

261
00:18:13.063 --> 00:18:14.856
- Why?
- Marius.

262
00:18:15.023 --> 00:18:17.400
It is the council's humble request...

263
00:18:17.567 --> 00:18:20.236
that you train us
to defeat him and his army.

264
00:18:21.905 --> 00:18:23.073
Move. Come on.

265
00:18:23.239 --> 00:18:24.908
The signal's coming from this way.

266
00:18:26.242 --> 00:18:27.952
Look, I understand you're reluctant...

267
00:18:28.119 --> 00:18:30.955
but as guests of the council,
we will be protected by law.

268
00:18:31.122 --> 00:18:33.291
My father wouldn't lie,
and he holds no grudge.

269
00:18:33.458 --> 00:18:36.419
- He had no love for Viktor, either.
<i>- Intruder. Intruder.</i>

270
00:18:36.586 --> 00:18:38.713
- Lycans.
<i>- Intruder.</i>

271
00:18:41.091 --> 00:18:43.885
- We must leave.
- You should accept the council's offer.

272
00:18:44.052 --> 00:18:45.971
- For Eve.
- Eve does not want my help.

273
00:18:46.137 --> 00:18:48.473
I know you want to protect her.
And if we destroy Marius...

274
00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.809
we destroy the greatest threat
to her safety.

275
00:18:50.976 --> 00:18:52.268
Now.

276
00:19:09.077 --> 00:19:10.412
Marius.

277
00:19:13.623 --> 00:19:15.125
We just missed them.

278
00:19:15.291 --> 00:19:18.837
I do not wish to hear
the word "just" again.

279
00:19:19.379 --> 00:19:21.589
Either we have her or we have nothing.

280
00:19:23.091 --> 00:19:24.801
Do you understand?

281
00:19:24.968 --> 00:19:27.053
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

282
00:19:44.821 --> 00:19:46.573
<i>Tango Charlie approaching.</i>

283
00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.116
<i>All clear.</i>

284
00:19:49.576 --> 00:19:51.286
<i>Perimeter secure.</i>

285
00:20:05.175 --> 00:20:06.801
- Welcome.
- Am I?

286
00:20:06.968 --> 00:20:09.512
Our coven's resources
and weaponry are yours...

287
00:20:09.679 --> 00:20:13.266
to transform these raw recruits
into Death Dealers worthy of your name.

288
00:20:13.433 --> 00:20:15.560
Varga will be your right-hand man.

289
00:20:15.727 --> 00:20:17.437
He knows all our strengths
and weaknesses.

290
00:20:17.604 --> 00:20:21.191
He is also our most prolific Lycan killer
with over 40 confirmed kills.

291
00:20:21.358 --> 00:20:23.276
- It's an honor.
- David, welcome.

292
00:20:23.443 --> 00:20:26.154
- Thank you.
- To mark the safe arrival of our guests...

293
00:20:26.321 --> 00:20:28.490
I've arranged a little soiree
in the Winter Garden.

294
00:20:28.865 --> 00:20:30.492
There's really no need. Thank you.

295
00:20:30.659 --> 00:20:33.411
Nonsense. There's always a need
to indulge in pleasure.

296
00:20:56.935 --> 00:20:58.645
In times of war...

297
00:20:58.812 --> 00:21:01.648
this coven needs moments to celebrate.

298
00:21:01.898 --> 00:21:05.777
The arrival of Thomas,
David and Selene...

299
00:21:05.944 --> 00:21:08.905
is reason aplenty to rejoice.

300
00:21:10.198 --> 00:21:12.242
To us all.

301
00:21:25.213 --> 00:21:27.507
It's good of you to offer us
sanctuary, Semira. Thank you.

302
00:21:27.674 --> 00:21:30.135
It will be entirely my pleasure.

303
00:21:30.343 --> 00:21:34.055
Tell me, is it true that her blood
brought you back to life?

304
00:21:34.222 --> 00:21:35.598
Yes, it is.

305
00:21:35.765 --> 00:21:37.517
I owe her everything.

306
00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:42.105
But, if you'll excuse me,
my father requests my counsel.

307
00:21:44.482 --> 00:21:46.109
Thomas was always such a bore.

308
00:21:50.155 --> 00:21:53.241
Well, Semira's certainly taken
an interest in you.

309
00:21:53.408 --> 00:21:56.161
Well, the interest is certainly not mutual.

310
00:21:56.328 --> 00:21:58.621
We need her protection.

311
00:21:58.788 --> 00:22:01.416
On the contrary,
I think I need protection from her.

312
00:22:01.583 --> 00:22:03.251
The Battle of the Peste.

313
00:22:04.002 --> 00:22:06.338
We thought it would be
the one to end the war...

314
00:22:06.504 --> 00:22:07.881
the final conflict...

315
00:22:08.048 --> 00:22:09.883
but here we are still.

316
00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:13.720
I hope you see my bid for clemency
for Selene for what it is.

317
00:22:13.887 --> 00:22:15.767
Well, clemency
is the least you can offer her...

318
00:22:15.805 --> 00:22:17.325
after bartering her daughter
to the Lycans.

319
00:22:17.349 --> 00:22:20.977
I lost so much during this war.

320
00:22:21.144 --> 00:22:24.481
Believe me, I am haunted still
by all those I failed.

321
00:22:24.648 --> 00:22:27.192
Well, then you must help me protect her.

322
00:22:27.359 --> 00:22:29.361
She has lost even more
than we can imagine.

323
00:22:29.527 --> 00:22:31.571
And she's important to me.

324
00:22:42.832 --> 00:22:45.168
Marius is out there...

325
00:22:45.335 --> 00:22:49.506
reeking of canine insolence,
plotting our downfall.

326
00:22:52.217 --> 00:22:56.179
We do not need Selene to destroy him.

327
00:22:57.138 --> 00:22:58.723
I am more than capable.

328
00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:01.393
No, Varga, you are merely adequate.

329
00:23:01.559 --> 00:23:05.105
It's fortunate that we're not forced
to rely on your skills for our survival.

330
00:23:05.522 --> 00:23:08.608
That, my sweet...

331
00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:11.194
yet unimaginative bedfellow...

332
00:23:11.361 --> 00:23:12.737
is my area of expertise.

333
00:23:12.904 --> 00:23:14.664
- I think you should...
- Don't think, Varga.

334
00:23:14.823 --> 00:23:16.574
You'll hurt yourself.

335
00:23:17.325 --> 00:23:21.371
There are other ways
to prove your devotion.

336
00:23:32.632 --> 00:23:37.095
Piece by delicate piece...

337
00:23:40.307 --> 00:23:42.976
the puzzle will fall into place.

338
00:23:44.853 --> 00:23:46.938
Oh, yeah...

339
00:23:48.231 --> 00:23:49.899
Yeah...

340
00:24:27.854 --> 00:24:30.106
Don't aim where the Lycan is. Anticipate.

341
00:24:36.321 --> 00:24:37.489
And remember...

342
00:24:37.656 --> 00:24:40.134
a Lycan is never more vulnerable
than when he's in wolf form.

343
00:24:40.158 --> 00:24:41.743
- What?
- That makes no sense.

344
00:24:43.578 --> 00:24:45.138
In wolf form,
they cannot use weapons...

345
00:24:45.246 --> 00:24:47.624
and their thinking
becomes much more primitive...

346
00:24:47.791 --> 00:24:49.000
driven only by bloodlust.

347
00:24:49.167 --> 00:24:51.920
- How many have you killed?
- I don't keep track.

348
00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:55.215
I'm increasing Lycan speed
by 20 percent.

349
00:24:57.550 --> 00:24:59.386
Please continue.

350
00:25:04.557 --> 00:25:07.394
My pack has probed the Eastern Coven's
perimeter for weaknesses...

351
00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:08.561
and there are none.

352
00:25:08.728 --> 00:25:10.768
And any direct assault
would trigger the lockdown...

353
00:25:10.897 --> 00:25:12.377
which makes the coven impregnable.

354
00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:15.240
Even if we could break inside
without losing 90 percent of our force...

355
00:25:15.402 --> 00:25:17.004
- they have fallback positions...
- This.

356
00:25:17.028 --> 00:25:19.781
- That can be...
- Is this ready?

357
00:25:19.948 --> 00:25:21.616
Yeah.

358
00:25:21.783 --> 00:25:24.244
When we have the hybrid's blood...

359
00:25:24.411 --> 00:25:26.162
we launch against the Eastern.

360
00:25:26.329 --> 00:25:28.623
Find Selene, and we find her daughter.

361
00:25:33.503 --> 00:25:35.422
My own invention.

362
00:25:35.588 --> 00:25:37.400
One of the first things
a Death Dealer must learn...

363
00:25:37.424 --> 00:25:38.943
is how to fight in a confined space.

364
00:25:38.967 --> 00:25:42.470
Of course, the one thing this
training session lacks is unpredictability.

365
00:25:43.763 --> 00:25:46.224
Perhaps you'll indulge me
and give my students...

366
00:25:46.391 --> 00:25:50.687
I should say your students.
A lesson in combat's unpredictability.

367
00:25:50.854 --> 00:25:54.733
It would not only honor us, but it
would be invaluable to their training.

368
00:25:54.899 --> 00:25:56.735
- I don't...
- Please.

369
00:25:58.486 --> 00:25:59.988
That's enough.

370
00:26:01.031 --> 00:26:04.200
Gather round.
We are going to school you...

371
00:26:04.367 --> 00:26:07.412
in the true nature of the Lycan warrior.

372
00:26:07.579 --> 00:26:11.624
For the sake of this lesson,
our esteemed guest Selene...

373
00:26:11.791 --> 00:26:15.170
will play the role of Death Dealer
bravely defending our fortress...

374
00:26:15.337 --> 00:26:18.923
and I will take the role
of Lycan villain...

375
00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:20.633
here to destroy it.

376
00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.302
Ladies first.

377
00:26:45.158 --> 00:26:46.242
Impressive.

378
00:26:54.167 --> 00:26:55.543
Come on.

379
00:26:58.630 --> 00:26:59.756
Come on.

380
00:27:39.796 --> 00:27:41.339
Tonight's lesson:

381
00:27:41.506 --> 00:27:44.884
Do not trust your opponent
to fight with honor.

382
00:27:45.051 --> 00:27:47.095
They are Lycan. They have none.

383
00:27:51.433 --> 00:27:52.642
Don't move.

384
00:28:00.859 --> 00:28:02.777
Nightshade.

385
00:28:02.944 --> 00:28:05.363
Leeches into vampire cells, usually fatal.

386
00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:08.783
But for one with her strength,
there will only be pain...

387
00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:10.160
followed by paralysis.

388
00:28:10.327 --> 00:28:11.870
I'll kill you.

389
00:28:13.163 --> 00:28:15.206
UV bullets.

390
00:28:21.046 --> 00:28:24.341
Did you honestly think
I would forgive you for killing Viktor?

391
00:28:24.507 --> 00:28:26.384
Varga, you have orders.

392
00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.180
Varga!

393
00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.962
I don't need you to train Death Dealers.

394
00:29:03.129 --> 00:29:05.048
I have Varga for that.

395
00:29:05.215 --> 00:29:07.884
All that I need to rule this coven...

396
00:29:08.051 --> 00:29:12.806
and end the march of the Lycans
is your blood.

397
00:29:20.021 --> 00:29:21.314
What about the bodies?

398
00:29:23.733 --> 00:29:25.151
Sound the alarm.

399
00:29:25.694 --> 00:29:27.946
Have the council find them.

400
00:29:28.113 --> 00:29:33.368
Conclusive evidence of the
atrocity committed by Selene.

401
00:29:42.752 --> 00:29:44.004
There's been a breach.

402
00:29:44.713 --> 00:29:45.755
We need to find Selene.

403
00:29:45.922 --> 00:29:49.384
- Cordoned off. Semira's orders.
- Step aside.

404
00:29:52.846 --> 00:29:54.097
David.

405
00:29:55.348 --> 00:29:56.516
Come.

406
00:29:56.975 --> 00:30:00.228
There's more than one way
to move around this coven.

407
00:30:00.395 --> 00:30:03.273
Amelia created these passageways
centuries ago.

408
00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:08.403
Where does this lead?

409
00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:12.198
To the private chambers,
including Semira's.

410
00:30:38.058 --> 00:30:39.726
What the hell have they done to her?

411
00:30:39.893 --> 00:30:43.021
<i>Machina sanguinem exhauri.</i>

412
00:30:43.188 --> 00:30:45.690
Bloodletting.

413
00:30:48.151 --> 00:30:52.322
Semira wants Selene's
most precious asset.

414
00:30:53.239 --> 00:30:55.408
- This is going to kill her.
- Eventually, yes...

415
00:30:55.575 --> 00:30:58.244
but it will be agonizingly slow.

416
00:31:03.208 --> 00:31:04.751
Look.

417
00:31:04.918 --> 00:31:08.421
This is designed to open the arteries
as wide as possible.

418
00:31:08.588 --> 00:31:11.883
If we're not very careful,
we will do her more harm than good.

419
00:31:12.425 --> 00:31:13.718
Careful.

420
00:31:32.237 --> 00:31:34.114
Is this hers?

421
00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:35.281
Yes.

422
00:31:35.448 --> 00:31:38.034
Selene uses only this
particular weapon.

423
00:31:39.953 --> 00:31:41.788
A known traitor within our walls.

424
00:31:41.955 --> 00:31:43.581
This is precisely what I foresaw...

425
00:31:43.748 --> 00:31:47.043
and what you assured me
you would prevent.

426
00:31:47.335 --> 00:31:49.129
Their blood is upon your hands.

427
00:31:49.295 --> 00:31:51.339
- Sir, I did everything...
- Do not speak to me.

428
00:31:51.506 --> 00:31:52.716
There can be no mercy.

429
00:31:52.882 --> 00:31:55.468
I want her hunted
to the ends of the Earth.

430
00:31:55.635 --> 00:31:57.512
It shall be done.

431
00:31:59.097 --> 00:32:00.932
And I want her captured alive.

432
00:32:03.685 --> 00:32:05.812
Is that understood?

433
00:32:05.979 --> 00:32:07.897
Perfectly.

434
00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:19.617
- We're running out of time.
- All right, take her.

435
00:32:19.784 --> 00:32:21.745
You must go north, far north.

436
00:32:21.911 --> 00:32:23.413
Var Dohr.

437
00:32:25.373 --> 00:32:26.583
No.

438
00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:28.710
Father and son united in treason.

439
00:32:28.877 --> 00:32:30.587
Carry on with Selene.

440
00:32:31.713 --> 00:32:32.714
I'll deal with them.

441
00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:43.141
Come on.

442
00:32:54.527 --> 00:32:55.820
Go! Now!

443
00:32:56.613 --> 00:32:58.114
No!

444
00:33:07.332 --> 00:33:10.377
<i>Dawn alert. 60 seconds to sunrise.</i>

445
00:33:10.543 --> 00:33:13.254
Go ahead. The sun will burn you
to ashes out there...

446
00:33:13.421 --> 00:33:15.423
or you can die
with some grace in here.

447
00:33:45.078 --> 00:33:46.538
They can walk in the sun.

448
00:34:05.015 --> 00:34:07.517
You need to feed.
You've lost too much blood.

449
00:34:25.618 --> 00:34:28.371
That child... Because he
helped that child of yours.

450
00:34:28.538 --> 00:34:30.957
My son is dead. Dead.

451
00:34:31.166 --> 00:34:32.208
David.

452
00:34:33.335 --> 00:34:34.336
Take her now.

453
00:34:34.502 --> 00:34:36.129
You must go north. Var Dohr.

454
00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.508
Go! Now!

455
00:34:53.104 --> 00:34:54.814
Thank you.

456
00:34:58.526 --> 00:35:02.405
I'm very sorry
that you lost your father.

457
00:35:02.739 --> 00:35:05.367
He put up a valiant fight.

458
00:35:05.867 --> 00:35:09.120
It's strange to lose someone
you feel like you never really knew.

459
00:35:11.122 --> 00:35:13.208
I feel the same about my mother, but...

460
00:35:14.417 --> 00:35:16.461
I have almost no memory of her.

461
00:35:17.545 --> 00:35:19.214
And I of Eve.

462
00:35:20.507 --> 00:35:22.300
I didn't want her.

463
00:35:22.801 --> 00:35:24.302
I didn't know her.

464
00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:26.221
And now I've lost her.

465
00:35:26.388 --> 00:35:28.640
Why do you insist on saying
that you've lost her?

466
00:35:29.182 --> 00:35:32.727
She made me promise
I would never look for her...

467
00:35:32.894 --> 00:35:35.605
that I would never consider myself
having a daughter.

468
00:35:36.398 --> 00:35:37.607
And she was right.

469
00:35:39.484 --> 00:35:41.945
Nothing good has come
to anyone I love.

470
00:35:42.445 --> 00:35:45.865
You're family,
and you're all I have left.

471
00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:50.286
Well, then, you really are in trouble.

472
00:35:52.247 --> 00:35:54.207
You need to rest.

473
00:36:03.091 --> 00:36:05.218
Selene's clearly in league
with the Lycans.

474
00:36:05.677 --> 00:36:08.471
Thomas and David were complicit
in this treachery.

475
00:36:08.638 --> 00:36:12.058
They walked in the sun. This alone
is evidence of Lycan collusion.

476
00:36:12.225 --> 00:36:15.186
Selene must be wiped from the pages
of our proud history.

477
00:36:15.353 --> 00:36:16.396
Alexia.

478
00:36:16.563 --> 00:36:19.482
- We shall avenge our fallen.
- See to it that you do.

479
00:36:45.633 --> 00:36:49.721
- How much nightshade did you use?
- I thought it best to err on the side...

480
00:36:49.929 --> 00:36:52.307
Varga, what have we said
about you thinking?

481
00:36:52.891 --> 00:36:54.476
The poison will dissipate.

482
00:36:54.643 --> 00:36:57.937
I need this blood untainted,
and I need it now.

483
00:36:58.104 --> 00:37:00.231
It cannot be rushed.

484
00:37:00.774 --> 00:37:02.108
It must run its course.

485
00:37:06.488 --> 00:37:08.239
It's definitely the car.

486
00:37:08.406 --> 00:37:11.826
But no sign of where they went.

487
00:37:12.452 --> 00:37:14.037
Spread out across the city.

488
00:37:14.204 --> 00:37:15.789
Search everywhere.

489
00:37:23.088 --> 00:37:26.466
<i>The train at platform four
terminates at this station.</i>

490
00:37:43.316 --> 00:37:44.859
Northbound.

491
00:37:59.332 --> 00:38:02.168
I will be more powerful...

492
00:38:03.378 --> 00:38:05.338
than Cassius...

493
00:38:07.632 --> 00:38:09.676
than any vampire in this coven.

494
00:38:17.767 --> 00:38:20.287
- What news of the search?
- Selene and David are heading north.

495
00:38:20.395 --> 00:38:22.731
- Of course they are.
- Your Grace?

496
00:38:22.897 --> 00:38:24.899
They will run to the only
remaining coven...

497
00:38:25.066 --> 00:38:28.278
to afford them safe haven:
Var Dohr, the Nordic fortress.

498
00:38:28.445 --> 00:38:30.196
But Var Dohr is only a legend.

499
00:38:30.363 --> 00:38:32.907
I would not give it
such an elevated status.

500
00:38:33.074 --> 00:38:37.495
It is a frigid, dreary outpost
full of pathetic, peace-loving cowards.

501
00:38:37.662 --> 00:38:40.040
You speak of it
as if you have actually been there.

502
00:38:40.206 --> 00:38:44.502
Where do you think I was
when Viktor wasted years with Selene?

503
00:38:45.754 --> 00:38:47.380
Prepare yourself.

504
00:38:47.547 --> 00:38:50.342
The journey's long,
and I need you to take it alone.

505
00:38:51.343 --> 00:38:53.637
I must be certain the traitor's there...

506
00:38:53.803 --> 00:38:57.724
before I risk sending a full squad
of Death Dealers so far from this coven.

507
00:39:30.006 --> 00:39:31.591
You need to be more careful.

508
00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:41.893
You need to be more gentle.

509
00:39:46.523 --> 00:39:48.108
- Have you found Selene?
- Yes.

510
00:39:48.274 --> 00:39:50.318
She is headed for the Nordic Coven.

511
00:39:52.821 --> 00:39:55.448
I risk everything for this.

512
00:39:55.615 --> 00:39:59.577
- For you, for us.
- I know, my love.

513
00:39:59.744 --> 00:40:03.039
Semira grows more insane
for power with each day.

514
00:40:03.206 --> 00:40:04.833
She must be stopped.

515
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.003
And every day, I fear more
what she will do if we are discovered.

516
00:40:09.504 --> 00:40:13.633
I cannot attack the Eastern Coven
without the blood of the hybrid.

517
00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:16.678
It's too strong, even for my horde.

518
00:40:17.804 --> 00:40:19.431
Selene...

519
00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:24.311
She is the key to the futures
of Lycans and vampires alike.

520
00:40:24.769 --> 00:40:26.730
You shall have her.

521
00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:56.301
Var Dohr is just beyond that ridge.

522
00:42:57.255 --> 00:42:59.132
Where is everyone?

523
00:42:59.924 --> 00:43:01.593
Watching.

524
00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:11.603
We come seeking sanctuary...

525
00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:13.396
not to fight.

526
00:43:14.814 --> 00:43:16.858
Then you've come to the right place.

527
00:43:21.905 --> 00:43:23.698
My name is Lena.

528
00:43:23.865 --> 00:43:25.700
Follow me.

529
00:43:26.951 --> 00:43:28.620
What was that?

530
00:43:28.787 --> 00:43:30.705
Some kind of trick.

531
00:43:57.857 --> 00:43:59.359
You must be Selene.

532
00:43:59.943 --> 00:44:02.362
Does the great Death Dealer
truly come in peace?

533
00:44:02.988 --> 00:44:04.990
- I do.
- And what about this one?

534
00:44:05.156 --> 00:44:07.367
This is David, son of Thomas.

535
00:44:07.534 --> 00:44:11.037
Who I haven't seen
for many, many years.

536
00:44:13.915 --> 00:44:15.750
You must excuse the attention.

537
00:44:15.917 --> 00:44:19.295
Our coven doesn't receive
many guests, by design.

538
00:44:19.462 --> 00:44:20.463
We do as we wish...

539
00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:23.216
- not as others would have us do.
- And what of the Lycans?

540
00:44:23.383 --> 00:44:25.719
We are too far removed
for them to take notice...

541
00:44:25.885 --> 00:44:30.098
and even if they did, our climate
is quite an obstacle to warm-bloods.

542
00:44:30.557 --> 00:44:32.600
This coven wouldn't exist...

543
00:44:32.767 --> 00:44:35.353
- without your mother's grace.
- You knew my mother?

544
00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:37.147
All vampires do, my boy.

545
00:44:37.314 --> 00:44:39.649
No. My mother was low-born.
She died giving birth to me.

546
00:44:39.816 --> 00:44:43.153
A falsehood, you will find,
designed to keep your true lineage safe.

547
00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:44.779
- Is she still alive?
- No.

548
00:44:45.322 --> 00:44:48.283
And her death
was a terrible blow to our kind.

549
00:44:48.450 --> 00:44:51.119
The mourning ceremony we held
lasted for an entire month.

550
00:44:51.286 --> 00:44:53.997
Such an honor is usually
reserved for a high-born...

551
00:44:54.164 --> 00:44:55.790
- a Grand Elder.
- Yes.

552
00:44:58.251 --> 00:45:00.003
- Amelia.
- Yes.

553
00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:02.672
How could a Grand Elder
have been my mother...

554
00:45:02.839 --> 00:45:04.049
and I not been told?

555
00:45:04.716 --> 00:45:06.551
I have something for you.

556
00:45:22.275 --> 00:45:25.862
Your father's greatest work,
infused with silver.

557
00:45:26.029 --> 00:45:28.615
The Lycans will cower
from the very sight of it.

558
00:45:28.782 --> 00:45:31.326
- It's beautiful.
- Thomas knew that one day...

559
00:45:31.493 --> 00:45:33.745
you would be beset
by enemies on both sides...

560
00:45:33.912 --> 00:45:34.954
and he was right.

561
00:45:35.121 --> 00:45:38.500
David, this means that you are
the rightful heir of the Eastern Coven.

562
00:45:38.667 --> 00:45:41.461
Your mother and father
spent many months...

563
00:45:41.628 --> 00:45:43.755
within the safety of these walls.

564
00:45:44.381 --> 00:45:45.757
Viktor grew suspicious.

565
00:45:45.924 --> 00:45:48.051
Then your father spirited you away...

566
00:45:48.218 --> 00:45:51.721
before Semira arrived with her troops.

567
00:45:53.181 --> 00:45:56.101
- And what of my mother?
- She returned to the Eastern Coven.

568
00:45:56.267 --> 00:45:57.435
The light in her eyes...

569
00:45:57.602 --> 00:46:00.480
Don't try and fabricate
some kind of martyrdom for her.

570
00:46:00.647 --> 00:46:02.416
I prefer a more honest
appraisal of her decision.

571
00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:05.902
She abandoned her only son
for the sake of her precious council.

572
00:46:06.069 --> 00:46:08.446
- Take it.
- David.

573
00:46:08.613 --> 00:46:10.198
David.

574
00:46:12.659 --> 00:46:14.911
Amelia asked me to give him this.

575
00:46:32.929 --> 00:46:34.889
What do you need?

576
00:46:35.056 --> 00:46:36.850
Nothing. I just need to be left alone.

577
00:46:37.892 --> 00:46:39.561
Yes, I know the feeling.

578
00:46:40.312 --> 00:46:42.147
Why didn't my father
tell me about my mother?

579
00:46:42.605 --> 00:46:44.190
I did not know your father well...

580
00:46:44.357 --> 00:46:46.818
but I know that his greatest fear
was to lose you.

581
00:46:46.985 --> 00:46:50.697
It seems it's the curse of every parent
to disappoint their child.

582
00:46:50.864 --> 00:46:52.995
At least you fought
for your child, Selene.

583
00:46:53.195 --> 00:46:54.259
Yes, and lost.

584
00:46:54.993 --> 00:46:57.829
You have pure-blood heritage, David.
Your mother was an Elder.

585
00:46:58.163 --> 00:47:00.457
Your parents kept you safe
for a reason.

586
00:47:00.623 --> 00:47:03.418
They protected you
so that one day you could lead.

587
00:47:05.587 --> 00:47:06.880
Your mother left you a gift.

588
00:47:10.425 --> 00:47:12.737
Oh, that's very kind of you,
but I have no use for jewelry.

589
00:47:12.761 --> 00:47:14.971
The ring is not the gift.

590
00:47:15.305 --> 00:47:17.849
It contains the gift: A mother's love.

591
00:47:19.059 --> 00:47:21.019
A single drop of her blood.

592
00:47:21.478 --> 00:47:23.355
Maybe it'll help you decide.

593
00:47:59.432 --> 00:48:01.142
You're just in time.

594
00:48:01.643 --> 00:48:04.437
- Come.
- What is this?

595
00:48:04.604 --> 00:48:07.774
- Valissa, the in-between place.
- Is she dead?

596
00:48:07.941 --> 00:48:09.859
No.

597
00:48:10.944 --> 00:48:12.529
She is...

598
00:48:13.446 --> 00:48:14.447
becoming.

599
00:48:14.656 --> 00:48:15.949
She took a poison.

600
00:48:16.116 --> 00:48:18.118
It allows her to visit the Sacred World.

601
00:48:18.535 --> 00:48:21.788
When she returns,
she will see this world with new eyes.

602
00:48:22.288 --> 00:48:23.790
I don't understand what this is.

603
00:48:23.957 --> 00:48:27.127
We have long known
there is more than just this world.

604
00:48:27.794 --> 00:48:30.005
When my father
first brought me down here...

605
00:48:30.171 --> 00:48:31.631
I felt as you do now...

606
00:48:31.798 --> 00:48:35.802
but I have since been
to the Sacred World many times.

607
00:48:37.053 --> 00:48:39.889
My eyes see beyond the surface
of so many things.

608
00:48:41.016 --> 00:48:43.560
- I see much about you.
- Such as?

609
00:48:43.727 --> 00:48:46.354
I can see you've loved a Lycan...

610
00:48:46.521 --> 00:48:49.649
- killed a vampire Elder, and given birth...
- Stop.

611
00:48:52.944 --> 00:48:56.364
I see you have lost your daughter...

612
00:48:56.531 --> 00:48:58.992
and how much pain
this gives you deep inside...

613
00:48:59.159 --> 00:49:01.119
where you will always hide it.

614
00:49:04.831 --> 00:49:06.207
She's a special child.

615
00:49:06.374 --> 00:49:08.668
Many battles will be fought...

616
00:49:09.461 --> 00:49:11.504
and lost over her.

617
00:49:11.671 --> 00:49:13.757
- What else do you see?
- Darkness.

618
00:49:13.923 --> 00:49:15.675
One that touches us all.

619
00:49:16.092 --> 00:49:20.096
If you want to keep her safe,
you will need to go further...

620
00:49:20.263 --> 00:49:24.225
than even a warrior of your renown
has ever ventured before.

621
00:49:24.392 --> 00:49:27.145
I have seen so much war...

622
00:49:27.312 --> 00:49:29.397
so much killing.

623
00:49:29.564 --> 00:49:30.732
I cannot bear more.

624
00:49:30.899 --> 00:49:33.276
The peace you will feel here is real.

625
00:49:33.443 --> 00:49:36.905
It seeps into your skin
and comforts your soul.

626
00:49:37.072 --> 00:49:39.074
Tell me about the Sacred World.

627
00:49:39.741 --> 00:49:41.993
The water is the path.

628
00:49:59.427 --> 00:50:00.428
<i>Amelia!</i>

629
00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:12.816
<i>I name our son David.</i>

630
00:50:12.983 --> 00:50:14.317
<i>David.</i>

631
00:50:15.276 --> 00:50:17.529
<i>One day, you will understand.</i>

632
00:50:17.696 --> 00:50:20.198
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

633
00:50:38.466 --> 00:50:39.926
Lycans! Sound the alarm!

634
00:50:40.093 --> 00:50:41.177
Close the doors!

635
00:50:41.886 --> 00:50:43.263
Move!

636
00:50:49.894 --> 00:50:53.481
Just as I spoke of peace,
war has followed you here.

637
00:50:53.648 --> 00:50:54.858
Protect your own.

638
00:50:55.025 --> 00:50:56.735
I must find David.

639
00:51:04.951 --> 00:51:07.871
- We have to get you away.
- No. We led the Lycans here.

640
00:51:08.038 --> 00:51:10.373
We can't let these people die.

641
00:52:10.517 --> 00:52:12.310
Run!

642
00:52:19.985 --> 00:52:21.069
This way, men.

643
00:52:23.822 --> 00:52:25.949
Go around that side.

644
00:53:01.359 --> 00:53:02.569
There she is.

645
00:53:23.923 --> 00:53:25.467
You parasite.

646
00:53:25.633 --> 00:53:26.843
Just do it.

647
00:54:25.318 --> 00:54:26.319
Marius.

648
00:54:27.237 --> 00:54:28.613
At last.

649
00:54:53.888 --> 00:54:55.056
On your right!

650
00:55:28.548 --> 00:55:30.050
I expected more from you.

651
00:55:48.652 --> 00:55:50.111
Tell me where your daughter is.

652
00:55:51.446 --> 00:55:53.490
I don't know.

653
00:55:53.907 --> 00:55:57.118
Selene, all I want is her blood.

654
00:56:08.755 --> 00:56:11.299
Only she can end this war.

655
00:56:12.050 --> 00:56:15.929
I give you my word
she will not be killed.

656
00:56:43.915 --> 00:56:44.916
What are you?

657
00:58:06.915 --> 00:58:08.083
Tell him where she is...

658
00:58:08.249 --> 00:58:10.502
and all this butchery
will be over forever.

659
00:58:10.669 --> 00:58:12.712
I don't know.

660
00:58:12.879 --> 00:58:14.506
Lies.

661
00:58:21.805 --> 00:58:22.806
They've gone.

662
00:58:23.807 --> 00:58:25.350
<i>Michael.</i>

663
00:58:26.226 --> 00:58:29.187
- I freed you.
<i>- Look at the eyes.</i>

664
00:58:29.896 --> 00:58:31.564
<i>Who I am?
Do you not know who I am?</i>

665
00:58:31.731 --> 00:58:33.650
<i>- My daughter.
- I don't want you.</i>

666
00:58:33.817 --> 00:58:35.568
<i>Don't look for me.</i>

667
00:58:36.778 --> 00:58:38.530
She's telling the truth.

668
00:58:40.782 --> 00:58:41.950
She doesn't know.

669
00:58:52.210 --> 00:58:54.629
My time is done.

670
00:59:08.184 --> 00:59:10.395
They are retreating.

671
00:59:16.234 --> 00:59:18.111
I'm running out of time.

672
00:59:18.278 --> 00:59:20.613
We must strike against
the Eastern Coven now.

673
00:59:22.282 --> 00:59:23.908
You know what you must do.

674
00:59:34.836 --> 00:59:37.130
Water is the path.

675
01:00:09.412 --> 01:00:10.789
Selene.

676
01:00:24.761 --> 01:00:26.346
<i>Praise the day...</i>

677
01:00:27.806 --> 01:00:29.557
<i>when it ends.</i>

678
01:00:29.766 --> 01:00:32.268
<i>Praise the ice...</i>

679
01:00:32.435 --> 01:00:34.062
<i>when it holds.</i>

680
01:00:34.854 --> 01:00:36.064
<i>Praise the sword...</i>

681
01:00:36.648 --> 01:00:38.692
<i>when it kills.</i>

682
01:00:40.068 --> 01:00:41.653
<i>Praise the life...</i>

683
01:00:42.696 --> 01:00:44.531
<i>that has lived.</i>

684
01:00:54.082 --> 01:00:55.917
It's time.

685
01:00:59.587 --> 01:01:00.964
Power.

686
01:01:01.131 --> 01:01:03.633
Such a seductively simple thing.

687
01:01:04.092 --> 01:01:07.262
Either you have it all
or you have nothing.

688
01:01:44.591 --> 01:01:46.718
How fascinating.

689
01:01:50.305 --> 01:01:52.557
<i>Amelia...</i>

690
01:01:53.141 --> 01:01:56.686
<i>The water is the path.</i>

691
01:02:08.114 --> 01:02:10.075
You should stay here, David.

692
01:02:10.241 --> 01:02:12.452
This can be your home.

693
01:02:12.619 --> 01:02:14.037
Marius is heading east.

694
01:02:14.204 --> 01:02:15.747
There's nothing stopping him now.

695
01:02:16.373 --> 01:02:19.334
And my people are beset
with enemies on all sides.

696
01:02:19.584 --> 01:02:21.586
How can I stay here and live...

697
01:02:22.295 --> 01:02:25.298
- while they die?
- They need a leader.

698
01:02:40.271 --> 01:02:42.440
<i>Gate secure. Perimeter check.</i>

699
01:02:44.401 --> 01:02:45.902
Miss me?

700
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:48.405
<i>- East gate is clear.
- West gate clear.</i>

701
01:02:49.364 --> 01:02:51.366
<i>Commencing perimeter sweep.</i>

702
01:02:54.202 --> 01:02:55.537
<i>Access granted.</i>

703
01:03:01.584 --> 01:03:03.169
What news do you bring?

704
01:03:03.336 --> 01:03:04.713
A massacre.

705
01:03:05.672 --> 01:03:08.258
The Lycans attacked
the fortress of Var Dohr.

706
01:03:08.425 --> 01:03:09.884
Lycans in the north.

707
01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:15.307
The Nordic Coven
was taken completely by surprise.

708
01:03:15.515 --> 01:03:19.227
- Dozens of vampires have been killed.
- Was Selene amongst them?

709
01:03:19.394 --> 01:03:22.772
Dead. Killed by Marius himself.

710
01:03:22.939 --> 01:03:25.358
Wherever Selene goes,
trouble surely follows.

711
01:03:25.525 --> 01:03:27.902
- What of David?
- I do not know.

712
01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:31.323
I only wished I had arrived sooner.
I might have helped in some way.

713
01:03:31.489 --> 01:03:34.159
Well, you've helped in so many ways.

714
01:03:34.326 --> 01:03:38.580
You've done exactly as I hoped
and planned, if not more.

715
01:03:39.789 --> 01:03:43.877
You see, information is power.

716
01:03:48.381 --> 01:03:52.010
And I collect it with a passion.

717
01:04:01.311 --> 01:04:04.314
Thank you for leading Marius
to the Nordic Coven.

718
01:04:04.481 --> 01:04:07.067
Your Lycan lover...

719
01:04:07.734 --> 01:04:10.862
must be delighted
with his momentary success.

720
01:04:12.238 --> 01:04:14.240
You thought I didn't know.

721
01:04:17.077 --> 01:04:19.162
Foolish girl.

722
01:04:27.712 --> 01:04:30.548
<i>Dawn alert.
60 seconds to sunrise.</i>

723
01:04:34.844 --> 01:04:38.807
The Lycan scourge
destroyed an entire coven.

724
01:04:38.974 --> 01:04:41.101
To hide behind these walls
increases their advantage.

725
01:04:41.267 --> 01:04:43.144
We cannot take the war to Marius.

726
01:04:43.311 --> 01:04:45.480
Should we cower in the safety
of these walls...

727
01:04:45.647 --> 01:04:49.234
- while he picks us off one by one?
- Curb your insidious comments, Semira.

728
01:04:49.401 --> 01:04:51.945
This coven has held for 15 centuries.

729
01:04:52.112 --> 01:04:55.782
- It will hold for 15 more.
- I hoped you would show strength...

730
01:04:55.949 --> 01:04:59.536
though I was willing
to settle for competence.

731
01:05:02.288 --> 01:05:03.498
I was wrong.

732
01:05:07.293 --> 01:05:09.254
What is the meaning of this?

733
01:05:09.421 --> 01:05:12.132
If this council is too weak
to take action...

734
01:05:12.298 --> 01:05:13.925
it is my duty to do so.

735
01:05:14.092 --> 01:05:18.972
You are relieved of your duties
as council members effective immediately.

736
01:05:22.392 --> 01:05:24.436
The traitor returns.

737
01:05:26.354 --> 01:05:28.982
Oh, you are a fool
to show your face here.

738
01:05:29.733 --> 01:05:31.776
I will make you pay
for what you've done, Semira.

739
01:05:32.277 --> 01:05:34.357
Marius and his army
are heading this way as we speak.

740
01:05:35.196 --> 01:05:37.782
- I come to save my people.
- Your people?

741
01:05:37.949 --> 01:05:39.951
Kill him. Kill him.

742
01:05:40.118 --> 01:05:42.537
You aspire to be the protector
of your bloodline...

743
01:05:42.704 --> 01:05:45.165
yet you kill your own kind
in pursuit of power.

744
01:05:45.332 --> 01:05:46.374
It ends now.

745
01:05:47.292 --> 01:05:50.628
I am David,
son of the great Elder Amelia.

746
01:05:51.504 --> 01:05:54.049
And I am the rightful heir to this coven.

747
01:05:55.383 --> 01:05:57.510
Amelia had no son.

748
01:05:58.970 --> 01:06:00.847
Well, she had the foresight...

749
01:06:01.014 --> 01:06:03.350
to know that my claim
would be challenged.

750
01:06:05.018 --> 01:06:06.019
For the council.

751
01:06:22.243 --> 01:06:23.620
Amelia.

752
01:06:37.676 --> 01:06:39.427
His claim is true.

753
01:06:40.553 --> 01:06:43.848
David is the last of the purebloods.

754
01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:48.353
Irrelevant.
You are outnumbered and outgunned.

755
01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:50.689
Varga, your orders still remain.
Kill him.

756
01:06:54.943 --> 01:06:57.821
- I said, "Kill him."
- No.

757
01:07:01.950 --> 01:07:03.284
You swore to serve me.

758
01:07:03.451 --> 01:07:05.620
I swore to protect
the leader of this house.

759
01:07:06.246 --> 01:07:07.414
<i>Breach detected.</i>

760
01:07:08.081 --> 01:07:10.250
<i>- Security system engaged.</i>
- Lycans. They're here.

761
01:07:10.417 --> 01:07:13.169
Lock her away until she can be judged
by the council.

762
01:07:13.753 --> 01:07:16.923
<i>Security system engaged.
Breach detected. Security system...</i>

763
01:07:17.090 --> 01:07:22.304
- She gets her damn war after all.
- Varga, you can still be forgiven.

764
01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:23.680
Gag her as well.

765
01:07:52.167 --> 01:07:53.918
Come on, move that truck. Move it.

766
01:08:00.842 --> 01:08:02.385
Watch your angles!

767
01:08:04.304 --> 01:08:05.305
Let's go!

768
01:08:29.162 --> 01:08:30.288
Hold your positions.

769
01:09:12.038 --> 01:09:14.708
- On the staircase!
- Behind you!

770
01:09:19.129 --> 01:09:21.673
- Fall back!
- Retreat!

771
01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:37.272
Behind the balustrades!

772
01:09:37.772 --> 01:09:39.316
Take them out!

773
01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:54.497
- Come on!
- Move, move, move!

774
01:09:56.333 --> 01:09:57.375
Move it!

775
01:10:05.675 --> 01:10:07.302
Fuck.

776
01:10:08.928 --> 01:10:10.847
Aim at the ready!

777
01:10:12.974 --> 01:10:14.476
Fire!

778
01:10:41.544 --> 01:10:42.962
Fire!

779
01:10:58.979 --> 01:11:01.064
Hide from the light!

780
01:11:06.236 --> 01:11:08.113
Run!

781
01:11:08.279 --> 01:11:09.614
Move!

782
01:11:12.325 --> 01:11:13.326
Shoot, shoot, shoot!

783
01:12:42.957 --> 01:12:44.542
Impossible.

784
01:12:44.709 --> 01:12:45.710
I saw you dead.

785
01:12:46.336 --> 01:12:47.337
I'm here.

786
01:12:47.504 --> 01:12:49.047
I brought backup.

787
01:12:57.347 --> 01:12:58.431
There are too many of them.

788
01:14:21.556 --> 01:14:22.724
I've already killed you.

789
01:14:31.149 --> 01:14:32.317
Marius!

790
01:16:18.673 --> 01:16:20.175
- Marius.
<i>- Please.</i>

791
01:17:04.302 --> 01:17:06.304
I wish your father
was alive to see this.

792
01:17:08.098 --> 01:17:10.266
His ridiculous dream
of you ruling this coven...

793
01:17:10.433 --> 01:17:12.268
will be the very thing that kills you.

794
01:17:17.941 --> 01:17:19.442
Missed.

795
01:17:28.034 --> 01:17:30.787
Oh, it worked.

796
01:18:00.108 --> 01:18:01.192
I'm one of you.

797
01:18:01.609 --> 01:18:03.528
No! No! No!

798
01:18:17.125 --> 01:18:18.710
You killed Michael.

799
01:18:22.672 --> 01:18:24.007
This is the last of him.

800
01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:12.472
<i>You're family,
and you're all I have left.</i>

801
01:19:12.639 --> 01:19:13.807
<i>Do you not know who I am?</i>

802
01:20:26.796 --> 01:20:28.089
Your leader is dead.

803
01:20:32.177 --> 01:20:34.137
Take your wounded. Leave.

804
01:20:35.764 --> 01:20:37.265
Leave!

805
01:20:44.147 --> 01:20:47.233
<i>We fought our greatest battle
in our darkest hour.</i>

806
01:20:48.234 --> 01:20:51.780
<i>After centuries of war
between vampire and Lycan...</i>

807
01:20:51.946 --> 01:20:54.908
<i>this may at last be a time of peace.</i>

808
01:20:56.284 --> 01:20:58.787
<i>We must once again
tend to our wounded...</i>

809
01:20:58.953 --> 01:21:00.413
<i>honor our fallen.</i>

810
01:21:00.580 --> 01:21:04.000
<i>Our final two covens
must find strength and unity...</i>

811
01:21:04.501 --> 01:21:06.961
<i>to heal and rise from the ashes.</i>

812
01:21:13.635 --> 01:21:15.804
<i>My journey has now come full circle.</i>

813
01:21:15.971 --> 01:21:20.225
<i>Once an outcast, I am now one
of three chosen Elders.</i>

814
01:21:20.392 --> 01:21:22.560
<i>From hunted to the highest honor.</i>

815
01:21:48.211 --> 01:21:50.505
<i>I have lived 1000 years.</i>

816
01:21:50.672 --> 01:21:53.091
<i>I may live 1000 more...</i>

817
01:21:53.258 --> 01:21:55.593
<i>or I may die tomorrow.</i>

818
01:21:58.179 --> 01:22:00.432
<i>But I no longer fear death...</i>

819
01:22:00.598 --> 01:22:03.518
<i>for I have known it once already.</i>

820
01:22:06.521 --> 01:22:07.856
<i>I am reborn...</i>

821
01:22:08.023 --> 01:22:10.984
<i>and my eyes have been opened
to the Sacred World...</i>

822
01:22:11.151 --> 01:22:13.987
<i>and to the promise
of what is yet to be.</i>

823
01:22:16.781 --> 01:22:18.825
<i>There is no beginning.</i>

824
01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:21.119
<i>There is no end.</i>

825
01:22:22.287 --> 01:22:24.664
<i>There is only becoming.</i>
